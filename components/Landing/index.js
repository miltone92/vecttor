      <ul>
        <li>
          Uses topical electrode placements, typically on the arms or legs.
        </li>
        <li>Sends information to the CNS via C fiber sensory neurons.</li>
        <li>
          Promotes the production of beneficial Neuropeptides, which:
          <ul>
            <li>Enhance microvascular blood flow.</li>
            <li>
              Counteract oxidative stressâ€”a primary cause of most diseases.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Boosts production of Neuropeptides including VIP, CGRP, IGF-1, C-AMP,
          and Melatonin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decreases disease-producing Neuropeptides like TNF, NFKB, and
          Substance P.
        </li>
        <li>
          Positive effects typically observed within 1-3 days, irrespective of
          the pathology.

          Asthma, Diabetes, Sickle Cell Disease, Rheumatologic disorders, and
          many more.

        <li>
          The key? It targets oxidative stress, a shared factor in many diseases
          and the end-pathway of physical injury.

      <p>
        VECTTOR has shown remarkable results in treating conditions like Chronic
        Pain, Diabetes, Renal disease, and Headache Syndromes. It&apos;s
        user-friendly and typically shows responses within 1-3 days. It&apos;s
        been presented internationally, such as at the Al-Hokiel hospital system
        in Demam, Saudi Arabia, with impressive results.

      <Heading2>Future Prospects</Heading2>
      <BodyText>
        We&apos;re actively developing a comprehensive webpage, including
        materials intended for Saudi Arabia and a textbook on the device&apos;s
        history, science, and application. Dr. Steve Sacks has several clinic
        concepts and eagerly awaits collaboration to expand VECTTOR&apos;s
        reach.
